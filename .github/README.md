<!-- CASTINGESSENTIALS -->

<!-- CUSTOMIZATIONS -->
## Customizations

### Crosshair
Custom crosshairs are disabled by default. To enable them, open `flawhud\scripts\hudlayout.res` and under **CustomCrosshair** change the values of **visible** and **enabled** from 0 to 1.

To change the style, under **CustomCrosshair** change the value of **labelText** to the corresponding letter below.

To change the color of crosshair or hitmarker, open `flawhud\resource\scheme\clientscheme_colors.res` and change the values of **Crosshair** or **CrosshairDamage** respectively.

To disable the hitmarker, open `flawhud\scripts\hudanimations_manifest.txt` and comment out the line containing **scripts/hudanimations_hitmarker.txt**.

### Code Pro Fonts
To enable the Code Pro fonts, open `flawhud\resource\clientscheme.res` in a text editor and add **_pro** as instructed in the file.

### Favorite Server
To set up a shortcut to your favorite server, open `flawhud\resource\gamemenu.res` and under **HomeServerButton** enter the connection string to your preferred server as instructed.

### Transparent Viewmodels
To enable transparent viewmodels, you must first install the mastercomfig's Transparent Viewmodels addon or update your graphics configs to work with this feature. Then open `flawhud\scripts\hudlayout.res` and under **TransparentViewmodels** change the values of **visible** and **enabled** from 0 to 1. For more information, read the the TeamFortress.TV [thread][tftv-link].

### Streamer Mode
For extra protection against stream snipers and DDoS attacks while live streaming, enable Streamer Mode in the **HUD Options**. This feature hides player names and other information that could let the viewers know where and who you are playing with.

### Competitive Closed Captions
Currently, there are only two supported languages for closed captions. These are English and Brazilian Portuguese. To enable competitive captions for other languages, type either `cc_lang english` or `cc_lang brazilian` in the developer console.
